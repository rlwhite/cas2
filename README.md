This is the second version of Clean and Simple (CAS) which is a framework
for applications for C++.  It is a project that is meant to be somewhat 
educational in nature, but also is meant to be usable for realworld
applications.  It is being developed using Test Driven Development.  A primary
goal is to keep the code clean and simple by applying the SOLID principles
as described by Robert C. Martin.
