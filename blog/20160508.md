It's been several days since I done any work on casTest (v2), so I guess I should first check out my _TODO_ list.

**TODO**
--------
* TestRunner tests:

>* <del>TestRunnerReportsNoFailuresWhenAllTestsPass</del>
>* TestRunnerReportsNoFailuresWhenAllTestsSkipped
>* TestRunnerReportsSkipWhenTestIsSkipped
>* TestRunnerReportsNoSkipsWhenAllTestsPass
>* TestRunnerReportsNoSkipsWhenAllTestsFail
>* <del>TestRunnerReportsNoFailuresWhenAllTestsPassOrSkip</del>
>* Maybe, TestRunnerReportsNoSkipsWhenAllTestsPassOrFail

* Split the code into multiple files
* Refactor *TestRunner::runTest()*.  Should *tryTest()* return the test result (PASS, FAIL, SKIP) ?
* Create test logger/reporter.  How should we format the report?  Use TAP-style output?
* Implement various for test writers
* Implement test construction macros

...
I think the next thing I'd like to do is to split the code into multiple files.  I suppose that the most obvious first step is to place *TestCase* into its own files.  Here's the initial plan:

*Test inferace: testCase.h, testCase.cpp
>* _TestCase_

*Basic tests: basicTests.h, basicTests.cpp
>* _PassingTest_
>* _FailingTest_
>* _SkippedTest_

*Basic test tests: basicTestTests.h, basicTestTests.cpp
>* _PassingTestThrowsNoExceptions_
>* _FailingTestThrowsTestFailed_
>* _SkippedTestThrowsTestSkipped_

*Test runner tests: testRunnerTests.h, testRunnerTests.cpp
>* _TestRunnerReportsNoFailuresWhenAllTestsPass_
>* _TestRunnerReportsAFailureWhenATestFails_
>* _TestRunnerReportsNoFailuresWhenAllTestsPassOrSkip_

*Test runner: testRunner.h, testRunner.cpp
>* _TestRunner_

As I look at the plan, I realize that this is probably not complete and that we may consolidate some of the tests into a self-test suite.  But, this will do for now and will get us started.

...

After moving _TestCase_ into its own files and adding it to the makefile, all tests still pass.

...

After moving the basic tests, all tests still pass.

...

After moving the test runner tests, I've run into a problem.  _TestRunner_ is still defined in casTest.cpp.  So, we'll go ahead and move it into its own files now.  (I think this is allowed.  I'm still refactoring....right?)

And....all tests still pass.
