Well, bummer!  It's been a full month since I've done done work on cas2.

OK.  So let's do a bit now.  

I've rethought the idea of having a single utility to run the tests and for 
doing utility test maintenance such as adding test suites/tests.  I now
think that the test runner, should be just that.  It should make the test
runner code a whole lot cleaner.  I think there could still be a place
for a swiss army knife type of utility, but if we have one, I'm not sure it
should run tests.  If it does, it would probably just execute the test runner
code.  This would like be a plug-in to the utility.

Also, I've run across a very good makefile website by Paul D. Smith 
(http://make.mad-scientists.net).  I think I'd like to start, well re-start,
by getting the project's make system redone in keeping with Paul's rules.

OK, so....let's get to it.
