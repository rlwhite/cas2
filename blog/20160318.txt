I've spent a fair amount of time trying to get a very basic make setup
for the new "CAS" framework.  CAS stands for "Clean and Simple".  The
goal is to create a framework based on Robert C. Martin's SOLID principles.

After trying to come up with a non-recursive make hierarchy that suits me,
I am abandoning that effort.  At least I am abandoning that effort for
the time being.

The first thing I'd like to do is to create a unit testing framework that
is simple to use and allows me to use TDD (Test Driven Development).  I've
create one in the past, and could just use that one.  I haven't really finished
it, but it is more than usable.  I do believe, however, that the exercise is
worth doing again.  I can think of it as a super kata of sorts.  So, the near
term goal is to create the testing framework for CAS2 using Test Driven
Development techniques.  A friend once said something about this being a bit
of a chicken and egg type of problem.  I guess that's true, but as much as
possible, I will write the test first.

Another advantage to starting over, is that it will allow me to capture my
progress in this informal way.

So, having a minimal make system in place.  I'll add a target for casTest, and
watch the build fail.  Well, I have a tiny bit more than just a make system.
I've also copied (and modified where necessary) a few scripts from the original
CAS project.  But, I am staring with no source files.

OK, so the build failed.  Now to get started.  Well, first let's get this
into a git repository.  Then, we'll get started.

OOPS! I guess I should have started with an empty directory struture.  No
worries, that's easily fixed....
